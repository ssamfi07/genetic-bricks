step 1:
READ the instance file -> contains:
    - the items with:
        - id
        - color
        - quantity
based on this file's contents, we determine which are our variants of generating combinations.
The item details are in itemcostvendor.csv. There items have multiple vendors with their own prices and shipping costs, currencies and status 
    (whatevs stuff only ported to the end result).

step 2:
ARRANGE the items:
    - filtered from the big itemcostvendor file
    - smart data structure design -> object oriented could work better
        - each item it's an object and all the details are in lists -> do json maybe??
    - NO
    - we need the duplicates for each item because only with the complete list of items we can correctly generate the populations
